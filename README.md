# Price-Prediction-of-Cryptos-and-the-Future-Impact
This project aims to evaluate the Bitcoin future value based on other independent variables such as S&P500 index fund, AMD stock price, Nvidia stock price. 

Extremely galvanized with the returns that the crypto market has vested the investors with raised several questions below:
1. What factors could've led to this?
2. Is there any relationship among different cryptocurrencies?
3. Are there any external factors that could affect the variation in the crypto market.


We first tried to determine the correlation among Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum using the correlation data from coinmetrics.com 
We then analyze the individual data of different cryptos in order to understand the variation of the prices.

After deciding on different factors we predicted Bitcoin prices using different machine learning models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Boosting, Random forest.

Please read the paper in the repository to fully understand the process we followed which would definitely benefits you!
